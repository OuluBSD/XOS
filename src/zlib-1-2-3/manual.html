<a name="Introduction"></a><h2> Introduction </h2>
     The <em>zlib</em> compression library provides in-memory compression and
  decompression functions, including integrity checks of the uncompressed
  data.  This version of the library supports only one compression method
  (deflation) but other algorithms will be added later and will have the same
  stream interface.
<p>
     Compression can be done in a single step if the buffers are large
  enough (for example if an input file is mmap'ed), or can be done by
  repeated calls of the compression function.  In the latter case, the
  application must provide more input and/or consume the output
  (providing more output space) before each call.
</p><p>
     The compressed data format used by default by the in-memory functions is
  the <em>zlib</em> format, which is a <em>zlib</em> wrapper documented in RFC 1950, wrapped
  around a deflate stream, which is itself documented in RFC 1951.
</p><p>
     The library also supports reading and writing files in <em>gzip</em> (.gz) format
  with an interface similar to that of stdio using the functions that start
  with "gz".  The <em>gzip</em> format is different from the <em>zlib</em> format.  <em>gzip</em> is a
  <em>gzip</em> wrapper, documented in RFC 1952, wrapped around a deflate stream.
</p><p>
     This library can optionally read and write <em>gzip</em> streams in memory as well.
</p><p>
     The <em>zlib</em> format was designed to be compact and fast for use in memory
  and on communications channels.  The <em>gzip</em> format was designed for single-
  file compression on file systems, has a larger header than <em>zlib</em> to maintain
  directory information, and uses a different, slower check method than <em>zlib</em>.
</p><p>
     The library does not install any signal handler. The decoder checks
  the consistency of the compressed data, so the library should never
  crash even in case of corrupted input.

<a name="Usage"></a><h2> Structures Usage </h2>
   The application must update <tt>next_in</tt> and <tt>avail_in</tt> when <tt>avail_in</tt> has
   dropped to zero. It must update <tt>next_out</tt> and <tt>avail_out</tt> when <tt>avail_out</tt>
   has dropped to zero. The application must initialize <tt>zalloc</tt>, <tt>zfree</tt> and
   <tt>opaque</tt> before calling the init function. All other fields are set by the
   compression library and must not be updated by the application.
<p>
   The <tt>opaque</tt> value provided by the application will be passed as the first
   parameter for calls of <tt>zalloc</tt> and <tt>zfree</tt>. This can be useful for custom
   memory management. The compression library attaches no meaning to the
   <tt>opaque</tt> value.
</p><p>
   <tt>zalloc</tt> must return <tt>Z_NULL</tt> if there is not enough memory for the object.
   If <em>zlib</em> is used in a multi-threaded application, <tt>zalloc</tt> and <tt>zfree</tt> must be
   thread safe.
</p><p>
   On 16-bit systems, the functions <tt>zalloc</tt> and <tt>zfree</tt> must be able to allocate
   exactly 65536 bytes, but will not be required to allocate more than this
   if the symbol <tt>MAXSEG_64K</tt> is defined (see zconf.h). WARNING: On MSDOS,
   pointers returned by <tt>zalloc</tt> for objects of exactly 65536 bytes <em>must</em>
   have their offset normalized to zero. The default allocation function
   provided by this library ensures this (see zutil.c). To reduce memory
   requirements and avoid any allocation of 64K objects, at the expense of
   compression ratio, compile the library with <tt>-DMAX_WBITS=14</tt> (see zconf.h).
</p><p>
   The fields <tt>total_in</tt> and <tt>total_out</tt> can be used for statistics or
   progress reports. After compression, <tt>total_in</tt> holds the total size of
   the uncompressed data and may be saved for use in the decompressor
   (particularly if the decompressor wants to decompress everything in
   a single step).

<pre><b>ZEXTERN const char * ZEXPORT zlibVersion OF((void));
</b></pre>
   The application can compare <tt>zlibVersion</tt> and <tt>ZLIB_VERSION</tt> for consistency.
   If the first character differs, the library code actually used is
   not compatible with the zlib.h header file used by the application.
   This check is automatically made by <tt>deflateInit</tt> and <tt>inflateInit</tt>.
<pre><b>
ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT deflateInit OF((z_streamp strm, int level));
</b></pre>
     Initializes the internal stream state for compression. The fields
   <tt>zalloc</tt>, <tt>zfree</tt> and <tt>opaque</tt> must be initialized before by the caller.
   If <tt>zalloc</tt> and <tt>zfree</tt> are set to <tt>Z_NULL</tt>, <tt>deflateInit</tt> updates them to
   use default allocation functions.
<p>
     The compression level must be <tt>Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION</tt>, or between 0 and 9:
   1 gives best speed, 9 gives best compression, 0 gives no compression at
   all (the input data is simply copied a block at a time).
   <tt>Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION</tt> requests a default compromise between speed and
   compression (currently equivalent to level 6).
</p><p>
     <tt>deflateInit</tt> returns <tt>Z_OK</tt> if success, <tt>Z_MEM_ERROR</tt> if there was not
   enough memory, <tt>Z_STREAM_ERROR</tt> if <tt>level</tt> is not a valid compression level,
   <tt>Z_VERSION_ERROR</tt> if the <em>zlib</em> library version (<tt>zlib_version</tt>) is incompatible
   with the version assumed by the caller (<tt>ZLIB_VERSION</tt>).
   <tt>msg</tt> is set to null if there is no error message.  <tt>deflateInit</tt> does not
   perform any compression: this will be done by deflate().
</p><pre><b>
ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT deflate OF((z_streamp strm, int flush));
</b></pre>
    <tt>deflate</tt> compresses as much data as possible, and stops when the input
  buffer becomes empty or the output buffer becomes full. It may introduce some
  output latency (reading input without producing any output) except when
  forced to flush.
<p>
    The detailed semantics are as follows. <tt>deflate</tt> performs one or both of the
  following actions:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Compress more input starting at <tt>next_in</tt> and update <tt>next_in</tt> and <tt>avail_in</tt>
    accordingly. If not all input can be processed (because there is not
    enough room in the output buffer), <tt>next_in</tt> and <tt>avail_in</tt> are updated and
    processing will resume at this point for the next call of <tt>deflate()</tt>.
</li><li>Provide more output starting at <tt>next_out</tt> and update <tt>next_out</tt> and <tt>avail_out</tt>
    accordingly. This action is forced if the parameter <tt>flush</tt> is non zero.
    Forcing flush frequently degrades the compression ratio, so this parameter
    should be set only when necessary (in interactive applications).
    Some output may be provided even if <tt>flush</tt> is not set.
</li></ul>
  Before the call of <tt>deflate()</tt>, the application should ensure that at least
  one of the actions is possible, by providing more input and/or consuming
  more output, and updating <tt>avail_in</tt> or <tt>avail_out</tt> accordingly; <tt>avail_out</tt>
  should never be zero before the call. The application can consume the
  compressed output when it wants, for example when the output buffer is full
  (<tt>avail_out == 0</tt>), or after each call of <tt>deflate()</tt>. If <tt>deflate</tt> returns <tt>Z_OK</tt>
  and with zero <tt>avail_out</tt>, it must be called again after making room in the
  output buffer because there might be more output pending.
<p>
    Normally the parameter <tt>flush</tt> is set to <tt>Z_NO_FLUSH</tt>, which allows <tt>deflate</tt> to
  decide how much data to accumualte before producing output, in order to
  maximize compression.
</p><p>
    If the parameter <tt>flush</tt> is set to <tt>Z_SYNC_FLUSH</tt>, all pending output is
  flushed to the output buffer and the output is aligned on a byte boundary, so
  that the decompressor can get all input data available so far. (In particular
  <tt>avail_in</tt> is zero after the call if enough output space has been provided
  before the call.)  Flushing may degrade compression for some compression
  algorithms and so it should be used only when necessary.
</p><p>
    If <tt>flush</tt> is set to <tt>Z_FULL_FLUSH</tt>, all output is flushed as with
  <tt>Z_SYNC_FLUSH</tt>, and the compression state is reset so that decompression can
  restart from this point if previous compressed data has been damaged or if
  random access is desired. Using <tt>Z_FULL_FLUSH</tt> too often can seriously degrade
  compression.
</p><p>
    If <tt>deflate</tt> returns with <tt>avail_out == 0</tt>, this function must be called again
  with the same value of the <tt>flush</tt> parameter and more output space (updated
  <tt>avail_out</tt>), until the flush is complete (<tt>deflate</tt> returns with non-zero
  <tt>avail_out</tt>). In the case of a <tt>Z_FULL_FLUSH</tt> or <tt>Z_SYNC_FLUSH</tt>, make sure that
  <tt>avail_out</tt> is greater than six to avoid repeated flush markers due to
  <tt>avail_out == 0</tt> on return.
</p><p>
    If the parameter <tt>flush</tt> is set to <tt>Z_FINISH</tt>, pending input is processed,
  pending output is flushed and <tt>deflate</tt> returns with <tt>Z_STREAM_END</tt> if there
  was enough output space; if <tt>deflate</tt> returns with <tt>Z_OK</tt>, this function must be
  called again with <tt>Z_FINISH</tt> and more output space (updated <tt>avail_out</tt>) but no
  more input data, until it returns with <tt>Z_STREAM_END</tt> or an error. After
  <tt>deflate</tt> has returned <tt>Z_STREAM_END</tt>, the only possible operations on the
  stream are <tt>deflateReset</tt> or <tt>deflateEnd</tt>.
</p><p>
    <tt>Z_FINISH</tt> can be used immediately after <tt>deflateInit</tt> if all the compression
  is to be done in a single step. In this case, <tt>avail_out</tt> must be at least
  the value returned by <tt>deflateBound</tt> (see below). If <tt>deflate</tt> does not return
  <tt>Z_STREAM_END</tt>, then it must be called again as described above.
</p><p>
    <tt>deflate()</tt> sets <tt>strm-&gt;adler</tt> to the adler32 checksum of all input read
  so far (that is, <tt>total_in</tt> bytes).
</p><p>
    <tt>deflate()</tt> may update <tt>strm-&gt;data_type</tt> if it can make a good guess about
  the input data type (<tt>Z_BINARY</tt> or <tt>Z_TEXT</tt>). In doubt, the data is considered
  binary. This field is only for information purposes and does not affect
  the compression algorithm in any manner.
</p><p>
    <tt>deflate()</tt> returns <tt>Z_OK</tt> if some progress has been made (more input
  processed or more output produced), <tt>Z_STREAM_END</tt> if all input has been
  consumed and all output has been produced (only when <tt>flush</tt> is set to
  <tt>Z_FINISH</tt>), <tt>Z_STREAM_ERROR</tt> if the stream state was inconsistent (for example
  if <tt>next_in</tt> or <tt>next_out</tt> was <tt>NULL</tt>), <tt>Z_BUF_ERROR</tt> if no progress is possible
  (for example <tt>avail_in</tt> or <tt>avail_out</tt> was zero). Note that <tt>Z_BUF_ERROR</tt> is not
  fatal, and <tt>deflate()</tt> can be called again with more input and more output
  space to continue compressing.
</p><pre><b>
ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT deflateEnd OF((z_streamp strm));
</b></pre>
     All dynamically allocated data structures for this stream are freed.
   This function discards any unprocessed input and does not flush any
   pending output.
<p>
     <tt>deflateEnd</tt> returns <tt>Z_OK</tt> if success, <tt>Z_STREAM_ERROR</tt> if the
   stream state was inconsistent, <tt>Z_DATA_ERROR</tt> if the stream was freed
   prematurely (some input or output was discarded). In the error case,
   <tt>msg</tt> may be set but then points to a static string (which must not be
   deallocated).
</p><pre><b>
ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT inflateInit OF((z_streamp strm));
</b></pre>
     Initializes the internal stream state for decompression. The fields
   <tt>next_in</tt>, <tt>avail_in</tt>, <tt>zalloc</tt>, <tt>zfree</tt> and <tt>opaque</tt> must be initialized before by
   the caller. If <tt>next_in</tt> is not <tt>Z_NULL</tt> and <tt>avail_in</tt> is large enough (the exact
   value depends on the compression method), <tt>inflateInit</tt> determines the
   compression method from the <em>zlib</em> header and allocates all data structures
   accordingly; otherwise the allocation will be deferred to the first call of
   <tt>inflate</tt>.  If <tt>zalloc</tt> and <tt>zfree</tt> are set to <tt>Z_NULL</tt>, <tt>inflateInit</tt> updates them to
   use default allocation functions.
<p>
     <tt>inflateInit</tt> returns <tt>Z_OK</tt> if success, <tt>Z_MEM_ERROR</tt> if there was not enough
   memory, <tt>Z_VERSION_ERROR</tt> if the <em>zlib</em> library version is incompatible with the
   version assumed by the caller.  <tt>msg</tt> is set to null if there is no error
   message. <tt>inflateInit</tt> does not perform any decompression apart from reading
   the <em>zlib</em> header if present: this will be done by <tt>inflate()</tt>.  (So <tt>next_in</tt> and
   <tt>avail_in</tt> may be modified, but <tt>next_out</tt> and <tt>avail_out</tt> are unchanged.)
</p><pre><b>
ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT inflate OF((z_streamp strm, int flush));
</b></pre>
    <tt>inflate</tt> decompresses as much data as possible, and stops when the input
  buffer becomes empty or the output buffer becomes full. It may introduce
  some output latency (reading input without producing any output) except when
  forced to flush.
<p>
  The detailed semantics are as follows. <tt>inflate</tt> performs one or both of the
  following actions:
</p><ul>
<li>Decompress more input starting at <tt>next_in</tt> and update <tt>next_in</tt> and <tt>avail_in</tt>
    accordingly. If not all input can be processed (because there is not
    enough room in the output buffer), <tt>next_in</tt> is updated and processing
    will resume at this point for the next call of <tt>inflate()</tt>.
</li><li>Provide more output starting at <tt>next_out</tt> and update <tt>next_out</tt> and <tt>avail_out</tt>
    accordingly.  <tt>inflate()</tt> provides as much output as possible, until there
    is no more input data or no more space in the output buffer (see below
    about the <tt>flush</tt> parameter).
</li></ul>
  Before the call of <tt>inflate()</tt>, the application should ensure that at least
  one of the actions is possible, by providing more input and/or consuming
  more output, and updating the <tt>next_</tt>* and <tt>avail_</tt>* values accordingly.
  The application can consume the uncompressed output when it wants, for
  example when the output buffer is full (<tt>avail_out == 0</tt>), or after each
  call of <tt>inflate()</tt>. If <tt>inflate</tt> returns <tt>Z_OK</tt> and with zero <tt>avail_out</tt>, it
  must be called again after making room in the output buffer because there
  might be more output pending.
<p>
    The <tt>flush</tt> parameter of <tt>inflate()</tt> can be <tt>Z_NO_FLUSH</tt>, <tt>Z_SYNC_FLUSH</tt>,
  <tt>Z_FINISH</tt>, or <tt>Z_BLOCK</tt>. <tt>Z_SYNC_FLUSH</tt> requests that <tt>inflate()</tt> flush as much
  output as possible to the output buffer. <tt>Z_BLOCK</tt> requests that <tt>inflate()</tt> stop
  if and when it gets to the next deflate block boundary. When decoding the
  <em>zlib</em> or <em>gzip</em> format, this will cause <tt>inflate()</tt> to return immediately after
  the header and before the first block. When doing a raw inflate, <tt>inflate()</tt>
  will go ahead and process the first block, and will return when it gets to
  the end of that block, or when it runs out of data.
</p><p>
    The <tt>Z_BLOCK</tt> option assists in appending to or combining deflate streams.
  Also to assist in this, on return <tt>inflate()</tt> will set <tt>strm-&gt;data_type</tt> to the
  number of unused bits in the last byte taken from <tt>strm-&gt;next_in</tt>, plus 64
  if <tt>inflate()</tt> is currently decoding the last block in the deflate stream,
  plus 128 if <tt>inflate()</tt> returned immediately after decoding an end-of-block
  code or decoding the complete header up to just before the first byte of the
  deflate stream. The end-of-block will not be indicated until all of the
  uncompressed data from that block has been written to <tt>strm-&gt;next_out</tt>.  The
  number of unused bits may in general be greater than seven, except when
  bit 7 of <tt>data_type</tt> is set, in which case the number of unused bits will be
  less than eight.
</p><p>
    <tt>inflate()</tt> should normally be called until it returns <tt>Z_STREAM_END</tt> or an
  error. However if all decompression is to be performed in a single step
  (a single call of <tt>inflate</tt>), the parameter <tt>flush</tt> should be set to
  <tt>Z_FINISH</tt>. In this case all pending input is processed and all pending
  output is flushed; <tt>avail_out</tt> must be large enough to hold all the
  uncompressed data. (The size of the uncompressed data may have been saved
  by the compressor for this purpose.) The next operation on this stream must
  be <tt>inflateEnd</tt> to deallocate the decompression state. The use of <tt>Z_FINISH</tt>
  is never required, but can be used to inform <tt>inflate</tt> that a faster approach
  may be used for the single <tt>inflate()</tt> call.
</p><p>
     In this implementation, <tt>inflate()</tt> always flushes as much output as
  possible to the output buffer, and always uses the faster approach on the
  first call. So the only effect of the <tt>flush</tt> parameter in this implementation
  is on the return value of <tt>inflate()</tt>, as noted below, or when it returns early
  because <tt>Z_BLOCK</tt> is used.
</p><p>
     If a preset dictionary is needed after this call (see <tt>inflateSetDictionary</tt>
  below), <tt>inflate</tt> sets <tt>strm-&gt;adler</tt> to the adler32 checksum of the dictionary
  chosen by the compressor and returns <tt>Z_NEED_DICT</tt>; otherwise it sets
  <tt>strm-&gt;adler</tt> to the adler32 checksum of all output produced so far (that is,
  <tt>total_out</tt> bytes) and returns <tt>Z_OK</tt>, <tt>Z_STREAM_END</tt> or an error code as described
  below. At the end of the stream, <tt>inflate()</tt> checks that its computed adler32
  checksum is equal to that saved by the compressor and returns <tt>Z_STREAM_END</tt>
  only if the checksum is correct.
</p><p>
    <tt>inflate()</tt> will decompress and check either <em>zlib</em>-wrapped or <em>gzip</em>-wrapped
  deflate data.  The header type is detected automatically.  Any information
  contained in the <em>gzip</em> header is not retained, so applications that need that
  information should instead use raw inflate, see <tt>inflateInit2()</tt> below, or
  <tt>inflateBack()</tt> and perform their own processing of the <em>gzip</em> header and
  trailer.
</p><p>
    <tt>inflate()</tt> returns <tt>Z_OK</tt> if some progress has been made (more input processed
  or more output produced), <tt>Z_STREAM_END</tt> if the end of the compressed data has
  been reached and all uncompressed output has been produced, <tt>Z_NEED_DICT</tt> if a
  preset dictionary is needed at this point, <tt>Z_DATA_ERROR</tt> if the input data was
  corrupted (input stream not conforming to the <em>zlib</em> format or incorrect check
  value), <tt>Z_STREAM_ERROR</tt> if the stream structure was inconsistent (for example
  if <tt>next_in</tt> or <tt>next_out</tt> was <tt>NULL</tt>), <tt>Z_MEM_ERROR</tt> if there was not enough memory,
  <tt>Z_BUF_ERROR</tt> if no progress is possible or if there was not enough room in the
  output buffer when <tt>Z_FINISH</tt> is used. Note that <tt>Z_BUF_ERROR</tt> is not fatal, and
  <tt>inflate()</tt> can be called again with more input and more output space to
  continue decompressing. If <tt>Z_DATA_ERROR</tt> is returned, the application may then
  call <tt>inflateSync()</tt> to look for a good compression block if a partial recovery
  of the data is desired.

     All dynamically allocated data structures for this stream are freed.

<a name="Advanced"></a></p><h2> Advanced Functions </h2>
    The following functions are needed only in some special applications.
<pre><b>
ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT deflateInit2 OF((z_streamp strm,
                                     int  level,
                                     int  method,
                                     int  windowBits,
                                     int  memLevel,
                                     int  strategy));
</b></pre>
     This is another version of <tt>deflateInit</tt> with more compression options. The
   fields <tt>next_in</tt>, <tt>zalloc</tt>, <tt>zfree</tt> and <tt>opaque</tt> must be initialized before by
   the caller.
<p>
     The <tt>method</tt> parameter is the compression method. It must be <tt>Z_DEFLATED</tt> in
   this version of the library.
</p><p>
     The <tt>windowBits</tt> parameter is the base two logarithm of the window size
   (the size of the history buffer). It should be in the range 8..15 for this
   version of the library. Larger values of this parameter result in better
   compression at the expense of memory usage. The default value is 15 if
   <tt>deflateInit</tt> is used instead.
</p><p>
     <tt>windowBits</tt> can also be &#8211;8..&#8211;15 for raw deflate. In this case, <tt>-windowBits</tt>
   determines the window size. <tt>deflate()</tt> will then generate raw deflate data
   with no <em>zlib</em> header or trailer, and will not compute an adler32 check value.
</p><p>
     <tt>windowBits</tt> can also be greater than 15 for optional <em>gzip</em> encoding. Add
   16 to <tt>windowBits</tt> to write a simple <em>gzip</em> header and trailer around the
   compressed data instead of a <em>zlib</em> wrapper. The <em>gzip</em> header will have no
   file name, no extra data, no comment, no modification time (set to zero),
   no header crc, and the operating system will be set to 255 (unknown).  If a
   <em>gzip</em> stream is being written, <tt>strm-&gt;adler</tt> is a crc32 instead of an adler32.
</p><p>
     The <tt>memLevel</tt> parameter specifies how much memory should be allocated
   for the internal compression state. <tt>memLevel=1</tt> uses minimum memory but
   is slow and reduces compression ratio; <tt>memLevel=9</tt> uses maximum memory
   for optimal speed. The default value is 8. See zconf.h for total memory
   usage as a function of <tt>windowBits</tt> and <tt>memLevel</tt>.
</p><p>
     The <tt>strategy</tt> parameter is used to tune the compression algorithm. Use the
   value <tt>Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY</tt> for normal data, <tt>Z_FILTERED</tt> for data produced by a
   filter (or predictor), <tt>Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY</tt> to force Huffman encoding only (no
   string match), or <tt>Z_RLE</tt> to limit match distances to one (run-length
   encoding). Filtered data consists mostly of small values with a somewhat
   random distribution. In this case, the compression algorithm is tuned to
   compress them better. The effect of <tt>Z_FILTERED</tt> is to force more Huffman
   coding and less string matching; it is somewhat intermediate between
   <tt>Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY</tt> and <tt>Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY</tt>. <tt>Z_RLE</tt> is designed to be almost as fast as
   <tt>Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY</tt>, but give better compression for <em>PNG</em> image data. The <tt>strategy</tt>
   parameter only affects the compression ratio but not the correctness of the
   compressed output even if it is not set appropriately.  <tt>Z_FIXED</tt> prevents the
   use of dynamic Huffman codes, allowing for a simpler decoder for special
   applications.
</p><p>
      <tt>deflateInit2</tt> returns <tt>Z_OK</tt> if success, <tt>Z_MEM_ERROR</tt> if there was not enough
   memory, <tt>Z_STREAM_ERROR</tt> if a parameter is invalid (such as an invalid
   method). <tt>msg</tt> is set to null if there is no error message.  <tt>deflateInit2</tt> does
   not perform any compression: this will be done by <tt>deflate()</tt>.
</p><pre><b>
ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT deflateSetDictionary OF((z_streamp strm,

                                             uInt  dictLength));
</b></pre>
   Initializes the compression dictionary from the given byte sequence
   without producing any compressed output. This function must be called
   immediately after <tt>deflateInit</tt>, <tt>deflateInit2</tt> or <tt>deflateReset</tt>, before any
   call of <tt>deflate</tt>. The compressor and decompressor must use exactly the same
   dictionary (see <tt>inflateSetDictionary</tt>).
<p>
     The dictionary should consist of strings (byte sequences) that are likely
   to be encountered later in the data to be compressed, with the most commonly
   used strings preferably put towards the end of the dictionary. Using a
   dictionary is most useful when the data to be compressed is short and can be
   predicted with good accuracy; the data can then be compressed better than
   with the default empty dictionary.
</p><p>
     Depending on the size of the compression data structures selected by
   <tt>deflateInit</tt> or <tt>deflateInit2</tt>, a part of the dictionary may in effect be
   discarded, for example if the dictionary is larger than the window size in
   <tt>deflate</tt> or <tt>deflate2</tt>. Thus the strings most likely to be useful should be
   put at the end of the dictionary, not at the front. In addition, the
   current implementation of <tt>deflate</tt> will use at most the window size minus
   262 bytes of the provided dictionary.
</p><p>
     Upon return of this function, <tt>strm-&gt;adler</tt> is set to the adler32 value
   of the dictionary; the decompressor may later use this value to determine
   which dictionary has been used by the compressor. (The adler32 value
   applies to the whole dictionary even if only a subset of the dictionary is
   actually used by the compressor.) If a raw deflate was requested, then the
   adler32 value is not computed and <tt>strm-&gt;adler</tt> is not set.
</p><p>
     <tt>deflateSetDictionary</tt> returns <tt>Z_OK</tt> if success, or <tt>Z_STREAM_ERROR</tt> if a
   parameter is invalid (such as <tt>NULL</tt> dictionary) or the stream state is
   inconsistent (for example if <tt>deflate</tt> has already been called for this stream
   or if the compression method is bsort). <tt>deflateSetDictionary</tt> does not
   perform any compression: this will be done by <tt>deflate()</tt>.

</b></pre>
   Sets the destination stream as a complete copy of the source stream.
<p>
     This function can be useful when several compression strategies will be
   tried, for example when there are several ways of pre-processing the input
   data with a filter. The streams that will be discarded should then be freed
   by calling <tt>deflateEnd</tt>.  Note that <tt>deflateCopy</tt> duplicates the internal
   compression state which can be quite large, so this strategy is slow and
   can consume lots of memory.
</p><p>
     <tt>deflateCopy</tt> returns <tt>Z_OK</tt> if success, <tt>Z_MEM_ERROR</tt> if there was not
   enough memory, <tt>Z_STREAM_ERROR</tt> if the source stream state was inconsistent
   (such as <tt>zalloc</tt> being <tt>NULL</tt>). <tt>msg</tt> is left unchanged in both source and

     This function is equivalent to <tt>deflateEnd</tt> followed by <tt>deflateInit</tt>,

   The stream will keep the same compression level and any other attributes
   that may have been set by <tt>deflateInit2</tt>.

</b></pre>
     Dynamically update the compression level and compression strategy.  The
   interpretation of <tt>level</tt> and <tt>strategy</tt> is as in <tt>deflateInit2</tt>.  This can be
   used to switch between compression and straight copy of the input data, or
   to switch to a different kind of input data requiring a different
   strategy. If the compression level is changed, the input available so far
   is compressed with the old level (and may be flushed); the new level will
   take effect only at the next call of <tt>deflate()</tt>.
<p>
     Before the call of <tt>deflateParams</tt>, the stream state must be set as for
   a call of <tt>deflate()</tt>, since the currently available input may have to
   be compressed and flushed. In particular, <tt>strm-&gt;avail_out</tt> must be non-zero.
</p><p>
     <tt>deflateParams</tt> returns <tt>Z_OK</tt> if success, <tt>Z_STREAM_ERROR</tt> if the source

   <tt>deflate()</tt>.  The text, time, os, extra field, name, and comment information
   in the provided gz_header structure are written to the <em>gzip</em> header (xflag is
   ignored &#8212; the extra flags are set according to the compression level).  The
   caller must assure that, if not <tt>Z_NULL</tt>, name and comment are terminated with

   before by the caller.
<p>
     The <tt>windowBits</tt> parameter is the base two logarithm of the maximum window
   size (the size of the history buffer).  It should be in the range 8..15 for
   this version of the library. The default value is 15 if <tt>inflateInit</tt> is used
   instead. <tt>windowBits</tt> must be greater than or equal to the <tt>windowBits</tt> value
   provided to <tt>deflateInit2()</tt> while compressing, or it must be equal to 15 if
   <tt>deflateInit2()</tt> was not used. If a compressed stream with a larger window
   size is given as input, <tt>inflate()</tt> will return with the error code
   <tt>Z_DATA_ERROR</tt> instead of trying to allocate a larger window.
</p><p>
     <tt>windowBits</tt> can also be &#8211;8..&#8211;15 for raw inflate. In this case, <tt>-windowBits</tt>
   determines the window size. <tt>inflate()</tt> will then process raw deflate data,
   not looking for a <em>zlib</em> or <em>gzip</em> header, not generating a check value, and not
   looking for any check values for comparison at the end of the stream. This
   is for use with other formats that use the deflate compressed data format
   such as <em>zip</em>.  Those formats provide their own check values. If a custom
   format is developed using the raw deflate format for compressed data, it is
   recommended that a check value such as an adler32 or a crc32 be applied to
   the uncompressed data as is done in the <em>zlib</em>, <em>gzip</em>, and <em>zip</em> formats.  For
   most applications, the <em>zlib</em> format should be used as is. Note that comments

</p><p>
     <tt>windowBits</tt> can also be greater than 15 for optional <em>gzip</em> decoding. Add

   detection, or add 16 to decode only the <em>gzip</em> format (the <em>zlib</em> format will
   return a <tt>Z_DATA_ERROR</tt>).  If a <em>gzip</em> stream is being decoded, <tt>strm-&gt;adler</tt> is

     Sets the destination stream as a complete copy of the source stream.
<p>
     This function can be useful when randomly accessing a large stream.  The

  This function inserts bits in the <tt>inflate</tt> input stream.  The intent is

</b></pre>
   <tt>inflateGetHeader()</tt> requests that <em>gzip</em> header information be stored in the
   provided gz_header structure.  <tt>inflateGetHeader()</tt> may be called after
   <tt>inflateInit2()</tt> or <tt>inflateReset()</tt>, and before the first call of <tt>inflate()</tt>.
   As <tt>inflate()</tt> processes the <em>gzip</em> stream, <tt>head-&gt;done</tt> is zero until the header
   is completed, at which time <tt>head-&gt;done</tt> is set to one.  If a <em>zlib</em> stream is
   being decoded, then <tt>head-&gt;done</tt> is set to &#8211;1 to indicate that there will be
   no <em>gzip</em> header information forthcoming.  Note that <tt>Z_BLOCK</tt> can be used to
   force <tt>inflate()</tt> to return immediately after header processing is complete
   and before any actual data is decompressed.
<p>
      The text, time, xflags, and os fields are filled in with the <em>gzip</em> header
   contents.  hcrc is set to true if there is a header CRC.  (The header CRC
   was valid if done is set to one.)  If extra is not <tt>Z_NULL</tt>, then extra_max
   contains the maximum number of bytes to write to extra.  Once done is true,
   extra_len contains the actual extra field length, and extra contains the
   extra field, or that field truncated if extra_max is less than extra_len.
   If name is not <tt>Z_NULL</tt>, then up to name_max characters are written there,
   terminated with a zero unless the length is greater than name_max.  If
   comment is not <tt>Z_NULL</tt>, then up to comm_max characters are written there,
   terminated with a zero unless the length is greater than comm_max.  When
   any of extra, name, or comment are not <tt>Z_NULL</tt> and the respective field is
   not present in the header, then that field is set to <tt>Z_NULL</tt> to signal its
   absence.  This allows the use of <tt>deflateSetHeader()</tt> with the returned
   structure to duplicate the header.  However if those fields are set to
   allocated memory, then the application will need to save those pointers
   elsewhere so that they can be eventually freed.
</p><p>
      If <tt>inflateGetHeader</tt> is not used, then the header information is simply
   discarded.  The header is always checked for validity, including the header
   CRC if present.  <tt>inflateReset()</tt> will reset the process to discard the header
   information.  The application would need to call <tt>inflateGetHeader()</tt> again to
   retrieve the header from the next <em>gzip</em> stream.

</b></pre>
     <tt>inflateBack()</tt> does a raw inflate with a single call using a call-back
   interface for input and output.  This is more efficient than <tt>inflate()</tt> for
   file i/o applications in that it avoids copying between the output and the
   sliding window by simply making the window itself the output buffer.  This
   function trusts the application to not change the output buffer passed by
   the output function, at least until <tt>inflateBack()</tt> returns.
<p>
     <tt>inflateBackInit()</tt> must be called first to allocate the internal state
   and to initialize the state with the user-provided window buffer.
   <tt>inflateBack()</tt> may then be used multiple times to <tt>inflate</tt> a complete, raw
   deflate stream with each call.  <tt>inflateBackEnd()</tt> is then called to free
   the allocated state.
</p><p>
     A raw deflate stream is one with no <em>zlib</em> or <em>gzip</em> header or trailer.
   This routine would normally be used in a utility that reads <em>zip</em> or <em>gzip</em>
   files and writes out uncompressed files.  The utility would decode the
   header and process the trailer on its own, hence this routine expects
   only the raw deflate stream to decompress.  This is different from the
   normal behavior of <tt>inflate()</tt>, which expects either a <em>zlib</em> or <em>gzip</em> header and
   trailer around the deflate stream.
</p><p>
     <tt>inflateBack()</tt> uses two subroutines supplied by the caller that are then
   called by <tt>inflateBack()</tt> for input and output.  <tt>inflateBack()</tt> calls those
   routines until it reads a complete deflate stream and writes out all of the
   uncompressed data, or until it encounters an error.  The function's
   parameters and return types are defined above in the <tt>in_func</tt> and <tt>out_func</tt>
   typedefs.  <tt>inflateBack()</tt> will call <tt>in(in_desc, &amp;buf)</tt> which should return the
   number of bytes of provided input, and a pointer to that input in buf.  If
   there is no input available, <tt>in()</tt> must return zero&#8212;<tt>buf</tt> is ignored in that
   case&#8212;and <tt>inflateBack()</tt> will return a buffer error.  <tt>inflateBack()</tt> will call
   <tt>out(out_desc, buf, len)</tt> to write the uncompressed data <tt>buf[0..len-1]</tt>.  <tt>out()</tt>
   should return zero on success, or non-zero on failure.  If <tt>out()</tt> returns
   non-zero, <tt>inflateBack()</tt> will return with an error.  Neither <tt>in()</tt> nor <tt>out()</tt>
   are permitted to change the contents of the window provided to
   <tt>inflateBackInit()</tt>, which is also the buffer that <tt>out()</tt> uses to write from.
   The length written by <tt>out()</tt> will be at most the window size.  Any non-zero
   amount of input may be provided by <tt>in()</tt>.
</p><p>
     For convenience, <tt>inflateBack()</tt> can be provided input on the first call by
   setting <tt>strm-&gt;next_in</tt> and <tt>strm-&gt;avail_in</tt>.  If that input is exhausted, then
   <tt>in()</tt> will be called.  Therefore <tt>strm-&gt;next_in</tt> must be initialized before
   calling <tt>inflateBack()</tt>.  If <tt>strm-&gt;next_in</tt> is <tt>Z_NULL</tt>, then <tt>in()</tt> will be called
   immediately for input.  If <tt>strm-&gt;next_in</tt> is not <tt>Z_NULL</tt>, then <tt>strm-&gt;avail_in</tt>
   must also be initialized, and then if <tt>strm-&gt;avail_in</tt> is not zero, input will
   initially be taken from <tt>strm-&gt;next_in[0 .. strm-&gt;avail_in - 1]</tt>.
</p><p>
     The <tt>in_desc</tt> and <tt>out_desc</tt> parameters of <tt>inflateBack()</tt> is passed as the
   first parameter of <tt>in()</tt> and <tt>out()</tt> respectively when they are called.  These
   descriptors can be optionally used to pass any information that the caller-
   supplied <tt>in()</tt> and <tt>out()</tt> functions need to do their job.
</p><p>
     On return, <tt>inflateBack()</tt> will set <tt>strm-&gt;next_in</tt> and <tt>strm-&gt;avail_in</tt> to
   pass back any unused input that was provided by the last <tt>in()</tt> call.  The
   return values of <tt>inflateBack()</tt> can be <tt>Z_STREAM_END</tt> on success, <tt>Z_BUF_ERROR</tt>
   if <tt>in()</tt> or <tt>out()</tt> returned an error, <tt>Z_DATA_ERROR</tt> if there was a format
   error in the deflate stream (in which case <tt>strm-&gt;msg</tt> is set to indicate the
   nature of the error), or <tt>Z_STREAM_ERROR</tt> if the stream was not properly
   initialized.  In the case of <tt>Z_BUF_ERROR</tt>, an input or output error can be
   distinguished using <tt>strm-&gt;next_in</tt> which will be <tt>Z_NULL</tt> only if <tt>in()</tt> returned
   an error.  If <tt>strm-&gt;next_in</tt> is not <tt>Z_NULL</tt>, then the <tt>Z_BUF_ERROR</tt> was due to
   <tt>out()</tt> returning non-zero.  (<tt>in()</tt> will always be called before <tt>out()</tt>, so
   <tt>strm-&gt;next_in</tt> is assured to be defined if <tt>out()</tt> returns non-zero.)  Note

      <tt>gzgets</tt> returns <tt>buf</tt>, or <tt>Z_NULL</tt> in case of error.
<pre><b>
ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT    gzputc OF((gzFile file, int c));
</b></pre>
      Writes <tt>c</tt>, converted to an <tt>unsigned char</tt>, into the compressed file.
   <tt>gzputc</tt> returns the value that was written, or &#8211;1 in case of error.
<pre><b>
ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT    gzgetc OF((gzFile file));
</b></pre>
      Reads one byte from the compressed file. <tt>gzgetc</tt> returns this byte
   or &#8211;1 in case of end of file or error.
<pre><b>
ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT    gzungetc OF((int c, gzFile file));
</b></pre>
      Push one character back onto the stream to be read again later.
   Only one character of push-back is allowed.  <tt>gzungetc()</tt> returns the
   character pushed, or &#8211;1 on failure.  <tt>gzungetc()</tt> will fail if a
   character has been pushed but not read yet, or if <tt>c</tt> is &#8211;1. The pushed
   character will be discarded if the stream is repositioned with <tt>gzseek()</tt>
   or <tt>gzrewind()</tt>.
<pre><b>
ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT    gzflush OF((gzFile file, int flush));
</b></pre>
     Flushes all pending output into the compressed file. The parameter
   <tt>flush</tt> is as in the <tt>deflate()</tt> function. The return value is the <em>zlib</em>
   error number (see function <tt>gzerror</tt> below). <tt>gzflush</tt> returns <tt>Z_OK</tt> if
   the <tt>flush</tt> parameter is <tt>Z_FINISH</tt> and all output could be flushed.
     <tt>gzflush</tt> should be called only when strictly necessary because it can
   degrade compression.
<pre><b>
ZEXTERN z_off_t ZEXPORT    gzseek OF((gzFile file,
                                      z_off_t offset, int whence));
</b></pre>
      Sets the starting position for the next <tt>gzread</tt> or <tt>gzwrite</tt> on the
   given compressed file. The offset represents a number of bytes in the
   uncompressed data stream. The <tt>whence</tt> parameter is defined as in <tt>lseek</tt>(2);
   the value <tt>SEEK_END</tt> is not supported.
     If the file is opened for reading, this function is emulated but can be
   extremely slow. If the file is opened for writing, only forward seeks are
   supported; <tt>gzseek</tt> then compresses a sequence of zeroes up to the new
   starting position.
<p>
      <tt>gzseek</tt> returns the resulting offset location as measured in bytes from
   the beginning of the uncompressed stream, or &#8211;1 in case of error, in
   particular if the file is opened for writing and the new starting position
   would be before the current position.
</p><pre><b>
ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT    gzrewind OF((gzFile file));
</b></pre>
     Rewinds the given file. This function is supported only for reading.
<p>
   <tt>gzrewind(file)</tt> is equivalent to <tt>(int)gzseek(file, 0L, SEEK_SET)</tt>
</p><pre><b>
ZEXTERN z_off_t ZEXPORT    gztell OF((gzFile file));
</b></pre>
     Returns the starting position for the next <tt>gzread</tt> or <tt>gzwrite</tt> on the
   given compressed file. This position represents a number of bytes in the
   uncompressed data stream.
<p>
   gztell(file) is equivalent to gzseek(file, 0L, SEEK_CUR)
</p><pre><b>
ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT gzeof OF((gzFile file));
</b></pre>
     Returns 1 when <tt>EOF</tt> has previously been detected reading the given
   input stream, otherwise zero.
<pre><b>
ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT gzdirect OF((gzFile file));
</b></pre>
     Returns 1 if file is being read directly without decompression, otherwise
   zero.
<pre><b>
ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT    gzclose OF((gzFile file));
</b></pre>
     Flushes all pending output if necessary, closes the compressed file
   and deallocates all the (de)compression state. The return value is the <em>zlib</em>
   error number (see function <tt>gzerror</tt> below).
<pre><b>
ZEXTERN const char * ZEXPORT gzerror OF((gzFile file, int *errnum));
</b></pre>
     Returns the error message for the last error which occurred on the
   given compressed <tt>file</tt>. <tt>errnum</tt> is set to <em>zlib</em> error number. If an
   error occurred in the file system and not in the compression library,
   <tt>errnum</tt> is set to <tt>Z_ERRNO</tt> and the application may consult <tt>errno</tt>
   to get the exact error code.
<pre><b>
ZEXTERN void ZEXPORT gzclearerr OF((gzFile file));
</b></pre>
     Clears the error and end-of-file flags for <tt>file</tt>. This is analogous to the
   <tt>clearerr()</tt> function in <tt>stdio</tt>. This is useful for continuing to read a <em>gzip</em>
   file that is being written concurrently.
<a name="Checksum"></a><h2> Checksum Functions </h2>
     These functions are not related to compression but are exported
   anyway because they might be useful in applications using the
   compression library.
<pre><b>
ZEXTERN uLong ZEXPORT adler32 OF((uLong adler, const Bytef *buf, uInt len));
</b></pre>
     Update a running Adler-32 checksum with the bytes <tt>buf[0..len-1]</tt> and
   return the updated checksum. If <tt>buf</tt> is <tt>NULL</tt>, this function returns
   the required initial value for the checksum.
   An Adler-32 checksum is almost as reliable as a CRC32 but can be computed
   much faster. Usage example:
<pre>     uLong adler = adler32(0L, Z_NULL, 0);

     while (read_buffer(buffer, length) != EOF) {
       adler = adler32(adler, buffer, length);
     }
     if (adler != original_adler) error();
</pre>
<pre><b>
ZEXTERN uLong ZEXPORT adler32_combine OF((uLong adler1, uLong adler2,
                                          z_off_t len2));
</b></pre>
     Combine two Adler-32 checksums into one.  For two sequences of bytes, <tt>seq1</tt>
   and <tt>seq2</tt> with lengths <tt>len1</tt> and <tt>len2</tt>, Adler-32 checksums were calculated for
   each, <tt>adler1</tt> and <tt>adler2</tt>.  <tt>adler32_combine()</tt> returns the Adler-32 checksum of
   <tt>seq1</tt> and <tt>seq2</tt> concatenated, requiring only <tt>adler1</tt>, <tt>adler2</tt>, and <tt>len2</tt>.
<pre><b>
ZEXTERN uLong ZEXPORT crc32   OF((uLong crc, const Bytef *buf, uInt len));
</b></pre>
     Update a running CRC-32 with the bytes <tt>buf[0..len-1]</tt> and return the
   updated CRC-32. If <tt>buf</tt> is <tt>NULL</tt>, this function returns the required initial
   value for the for the crc. Pre- and post-conditioning (one's complement) is
   performed within this function so it shouldn't be done by the application.
   Usage example:
<pre>     uLong crc = crc32(0L, Z_NULL, 0);

     while (read_buffer(buffer, length) != EOF) {
       crc = crc32(crc, buffer, length);
     }
     if (crc != original_crc) error();
</pre>
<pre><b>
ZEXTERN uLong ZEXPORT crc32_combine OF((uLong crc1, uLong crc2, z_off_t len2));
</b></pre>
   Combine two CRC-32 check values into one.  For two sequences of bytes,
   <tt>seq1</tt> and <tt>seq2</tt> with lengths <tt>len1</tt> and <tt>len2</tt>, CRC-32 check values were
   calculated for each, <tt>crc1</tt> and <tt>crc2</tt>.  <tt>crc32_combine()</tt> returns the CRC-32
   check value of <tt>seq1</tt> and <tt>seq2</tt> concatenated, requiring only <tt>crc1</tt>, <tt>crc2</tt>, and
   <tt>len2</tt>.
